Download presentations from the WIPO workshops on open source patent analytics here. To download the datasets used in the presentations go to https://github.com/wipo-analytics/opensource-patent-analytics/tree/master/2_datasets . Make sure to download the raw files. You will mainly need the `drones_copy` (open refine), `pizza_medium_clean` (tableau) and the `synbio_patents` (gephi) datasets.
